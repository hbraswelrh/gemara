## What You'll Build

| Layer | Artifact | Guide |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Layer 1** — Guidance | Guidance Catalog (guidelines, families, mapping-references) | *(tutorial coming later)* |
| **Layer 2** — Controls | Threat Catalog + Control Catalog (assessment requirements, threat-mappings) | [Threat Assessment](controls/threat-assessment-guide), [Control Catalog](controls/control-catalog-guide) |
| **Layer 3** — Policy | Policy Document (scope, imports, adherence, risks) | *(tutorial coming later)* |

For who *writes* vs. who *ingests* each layer, see [Persona–Layer Alignment](persona-layer-alignment).
