    title: Use Immutable Image References by Digest
    objective: |
      Ensure the container management tool resolves and uses container images
      by digest (or digest-plus-tag) so that image identity is immutable and
      tampering or tag swapping cannot substitute a different image.
    family: SEC.SLAM.CM.FAM01
    assessment-requirements:
      - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL01.AR01
        text: |
          The system MUST resolve image references to a digest (e.g., sha256:...)
          before pull or run and MUST use that digest for all subsequent use.
        applicability: ["all deployments"]
      - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL01.AR02
        text: |
          Configuration and policies MUST disallow or override use of tag-only
          references for production or sensitive workloads where supported.
        applicability: ["production", "sensitive workloads"]
