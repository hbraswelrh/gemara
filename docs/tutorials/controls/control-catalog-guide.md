description: Step-by-step guide to creating Gemara-compatible control catalogs
---

## What This Is

This guide walks through creating a **control catalog** using the [Gemara](https://gemara.openssf.org/) project, building on the threats and scope you identified in the [Threat Assessment Guide](threat-assessment-guide).

In technical terms:
* **Controls** are safeguards with a stated objective and a list of assessment requirements.
* **Families** group related controls by domain (e.g., supply chain, access control).
* **Threats** link each control to the threat(s) it mitigates, connecting your control catalog to your layer 2 threat catalog.

This exercise produces a structured way to develop control objectives and corresponding testable conditions to determine if the objective is met.

## Optional Workflow

Complete the [Threat Assessment Guide](threat-assessment-guide) for your scope (e.g., the container management tool **SEC.SLAM.CM**). You can reference the linked `threats` and `guidelines` to support the intent of Controls in the catalog. 


## Walkthrough

### Step 0: Define Scope and References

Reuse the same component or technology as your threat assessment. You will reference that threat catalog so controls can map to the threats you identified.

**Leverage existing resources**: As with threat catalogs, you can import controls from external catalogs (e.g., FINOS Common Cloud Controls, OSPS Baseline) via `mapping-references` and specify further using `source-reference` and `target-reference` in a **separate Mapping Document**. Review the mapping tutorial to map external catalogs to your target objectives. 

We continue with the container management tool example (SEC.SLAM.CM) and assume a threat catalog for it already exists.

### Step 1: Setting Up Metadata

Declare your control catalog and mapping references. Key fields:

| Field                               | What It Is                                                   | Why                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`                             | Display name for the control catalog (top-level field)       | Human-readable label used in reports and tooling output                                   |
| `mapping-references` with `id: CCC` | Optional pointer to CCC or another control/threat catalog in separate Mapping Document    |  Reference Mapping Document tutorial  |

**Example (YAML):**

```yaml
title: Container Management Tool Security Control Catalog
metadata:
  id: SEC.SLAM.CM
  description: Control catalog for container management tool security; mitigates threats from the SEC.SLAM.CM threat catalog.
  version: 1.0.0
  author:
    id: example
    name: Example
    type: Human
  mapping-references:
    - id: SEC.SLAM.CM
      title: Container Management Tool Security Threat Catalog
      version: "1.0.0"
      url: file://threats.yaml
      description: |
        Threat catalog for the same scope; provides threat IDs for threat-mappings.
    - id: CCC
      title: Common Cloud Controls Core
      version: v2025.10
      url: https://github.com/finos/common-cloud-controls/releases
      description: |
        Foundational repository of reusable security controls, capabilities,
        and threat models maintained by FINOS.
```

### Step 2: Define Control Families

**Families** group controls by theme. The Layer 2 schema requires at least one family when the catalog defines its own `controls`. Each control's `family` field must match the `id` of one of these groups.

Required fields for each family (see `base.cue`):

| Field         | Required | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | Yes      | Unique identifier referenced by controls     |
| `title`       | Yes      | Short name for the family                    |
| `description` | Yes      | Explanation of what controls in this family address |

**Example (YAML):**

```yaml
families:
  - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.FAM01
    title: Image Integrity and Supply Chain
    description: |
      Controls that ensure container images are authentic, unmodified,
      and from trusted sources throughout retrieval and use.
```

### Step 3: Import or Define Controls

**Option A — Import Controls:** If an external catalog (e.g., CCC) defines controls that address your threats, reference it in the `mapping-references` and list the control IDs in `imported-controls`.

**Example (YAML):**

```yaml
imported-controls:
  - reference-id: CCC
    entries:
      - reference-id: CCC.Core.CTL42
        remarks: Image signing and verification
```

**Option B — Define your own controls:** For controls specific to your scope, define them under `controls`. Required and common fields (see `layer-2.cue`):

| Field                    | Required | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                     | Yes      | Unique identifier (e.g., `ORG.PROJ.COMPONENT.CTL##`)                        |
| `title`                  | Yes      | Short name describing the control                                           |
| `objective`              | Yes      | Unified statement of intent for the control                                 |
| `family`                 | Yes      | `id` of a family in this catalog (or in a referenced catalog for imports)  |
| `assessment-requirements`| Yes      | List of verifiable conditions; each has `id`, `text`, `applicability`      |
| `threats`        | No       | Links to threat catalog(s) and threat IDs this control mitigates            |
| `state`                  | Yes       | Lifecycle: `Active` (default), `Draft`, `Deprecated`, `Retired`             |

Each **assessment requirement** (see `layer-2.cue`) must have:

| Field           | Required | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | Yes      | Unique within the control (e.g., `SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL01.AR01`)                 |
| `text`          | Yes      | Verifiable condition (typically a MUST statement)                           |
| `applicability` | Yes      | List of strings describing when this requirement applies                    |

**Example (YAML):**

```yaml
controls:
  - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL01
    title: Use Immutable Image References by Digest
    objective: |
      Require signature validation so that only legitimate, trusted images are
      accepted; then pin each image to an immutable digest (e.g., sha256)
      after the check so that what is used matches what was verified and
      TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) attacks are prevented.
    threats:
      - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM
        entries:
          - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM.THR01
          - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM.THR03
          - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM.THR04
      - reference-id: CCC
        entries:
          - reference-id: CCC.Core.TH14
  - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL02
    title: Require TLS/SSL with Certificate Pinning
    objective: |
      Mitigate MITM Container Image Interception by protecting registry traffic and verifying artifact integrity: use
      TLS/SSL with certificate pinning for all registry communication, use VPNs on untrusted networks to reduce interception risk, and verify artifact signatures or hashes so that tampered or redirected content is detected even if the channel is compromised.
    threats:
      - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM
        entries:
          - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM.THR02
      - reference-id: CCC
        entries:
          - reference-id: CCC.Core.TH02
    family: SEC.SLAM.CM.FAM01
    state: Active
    assessment-requirements:
      - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL02.AR01
        text: |
          The system MUST use TLS/SSL for all registry communication and MUST pin to the expected server certificate or public key (or certificate chain) for the registry.
        applicability: ["all deployments"]
        state: Active
      - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL02.AR02
        text: |
          On untrusted networks, the system or deployment pipeline MUST use a VPN or other trusted path for registry traffic, or MUST restrict
          image pulls to environments where the network is trusted.
        applicability: ["untrusted networks", "CI/CD"]
        state: Active
      - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL02.AR03
        text: |
          The system MUST verify artifact signatures or hashes (e.g. signature verification, digest check) before use so that tampered or redirected artifacts are rejected.
        applicability: ["all deployments"]
        state: Active
```

### Step 4: Validate Against the Layer 2 Schema

Validate the final catalog with CUE:

**Validation commands:**

```bash
go install cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue@latest
cue vet -c -d '#ControlCatalog' github.com/gemaraproj/gemara@latest your-control-catalog.yaml
```

Fix any reported errors (e.g., missing required fields, invalid `family` reference, or malformed `threats`) so the catalog is schema-consistent.

### Step 5: Assemble the Full Catalog and Validate

Combine metadata, mapping-references, families, imported-controls (if any), and controls into a single YAML document. A complete, schema-valid catalog for the SEC.SLAM.CM scenario is in [control-catalog.yaml](control-catalog.yaml) in this directory.

**Complete example (SEC.SLAM.CM):**

```yaml
title: Container Management Tool Security Control Catalog

metadata:
  id: SEC.SLAM.CM
  description: |
    Control catalog for container management tool security; mitigates threats
    from the SEC.SLAM.CM threat catalog.
  version: 1.0.0
  author:

    name: Example
    type: Human
  mapping-references:
    - id: SEC.SLAM.CM
      title: Container Management Tool Security Threat Catalog
      version: "1.0.0"
      url: https://example.org/catalogs/SEC.SLAM.CM-threats.yaml
      description: |
        Threat catalog for the same scope; provides threat IDs for threat-mappings.
    - id: CCC
      title: Common Cloud Controls Core

        and threat models maintained by FINOS.

families:
  - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.FAM01
    title: Image Integrity and Supply Chain
    description: |
      Controls that ensure container images are authentic, unmodified, and from trusted sources throughout retrieval and use.

imported-controls:
  - reference-id: CCC
    entries:
      - reference-id: CCC.Core.CTL42
        remarks: Image signing and verification

controls:
  - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL01
    title: Use Immutable Image References by Digest
    objective: |
      Require signature validation so that only legitimate, trusted images are accepted; then pin each image to an immutable digest (e.g., sha256) after the check so that what is used matches what was verified and TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) attacks are prevented.
    threats:
      - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM
        entries:
          - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM.THR01
          - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM.THR03
          - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM.THR04
      - reference-id: CCC
        entries:
          - reference-id: CCC.Core.TH14
  - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL02
    title: Require TLS/SSL with Certificate Pinning
    objective: |
      Mitigate MITM Container Image Interception by protecting registry traffic and verifying artifact integrity: use
      TLS/SSL with certificate pinning for all registry communication, use VPNs on untrusted networks to reduce interception risk, and verify artifact signatures or hashes so that tampered or redirected content is detected even if the channel is compromised.
    threats:
      - reference-id: SEC.SLAM.CM

        entries:
          - reference-id: CCC.Core.TH02
    family: SEC.SLAM.CM.FAM01
    state: Active
    assessment-requirements:
      - id: SEC.SLAM.CM.CTL02.AR01
        text: |
          The system MUST use TLS/SSL for all registry communication and MUST pin to the expected server certificate or public key (or certificate chain) for the registry.
        applicability: ["all deployments"]

        applicability: ["all deployments"]
        state: Active
```

**Validate** from the repo root:

```bash
cue vet -c -d '#ControlCatalog' ./layer-2.cue ./metadata.cue ./mapping.cue ./base.cue docs/tutorials/controls/control-catalog.yaml
```

Fix any reported errors (e.g., missing required fields, invalid `family` reference, or malformed `threats`) so the catalog is schema-consistent.

## Summary: From Threat Assessment to Control Catalog

| From threat assessment        | Use in control catalog                                      |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope / catalog id (e.g. SEC.SLAM.CM) | Same id in control catalog metadata; reference in Mapping Document Tutorial|
| Threat IDs (e.g. SEC.SLAM.CM.THR01, CCC.Core.TH14) | `threats` on each control that mitigates those threats |
| Understanding of what goes wrong | Control objectives and assessment requirements that prevent or detect it |

## What's Next

Use the control catalog in downstream Gemara layers: for example, map controls to Layer 1 guidelines via `guidelines`, or use the catalog in Layer 5 evaluations to record which assessment requirements have been verified.

See the [Gemara Layer 2 schema documentation](https://gemara.openssf.org/schema/layer-2.html) for the full specification and optional fields (e.g., `state`, `replaced-by`, `guidelines`).
