title: OSSF Toolbelt Personas ↔ Gemara Layer Alignment
---

This document maps [OSSF Toolbelt personas](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/tree/main/personas) to the [Gemara](https://gemara.openssf.org/) seven-layer model. **Step-by-step tutorials available today:** [Threat Assessment](controls/threat-assessment-guide) and [Control Catalog Guide](controls/control-catalog-guide) (Layer 2). Layer 1 (guidance) and Layer 3 (policy) tutorials are coming later. This narrative explains who typically writes or ingests each layer's artifacts and how the personas align with those flows.

## Tutorial primary personas

| Layer | Primary persona | Role |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| **Layer 1** | **Sachiko** | Solution Architect; guidance catalogs for org/domain reuse. For regulator context: **Grear** or **Regulated Ragnar**. |
| **Layer 2** | **Pang** | Product Security Engineer; threat and control catalogs (assessment requirements). |
| **Layer 3** | **Guinevere** | GRC / Security Governance Lead; policy (scope, imports, adherence, risks). |

Who writes vs. ingests each layer: see [Tutorial user journeys](#tutorial-user-journeys-writing-vs-ingesting) below.

## Mapping by Persona Type (Detail)

### 1. Security Engineer → Layers 2, 3, 5

- **Pang (Product Security Engineer)**
  - Bakes security into backlogs, uses standards (e.g. SLSA, SAMM), integrates tooling with CI/CD.
  - **Layer 2**: Authors or adopts **control catalogs** with assessment requirements; **Layer 5**: Uses evaluation tooling (e.g. Privateer) that produces logs keyed to `control-id` and assessment requirements (see `pvtr-baseline-scan.yaml`).

- **Guinevere (GRC / Security Governance Lead)**
  - Defines "secure enough," policy-as-code, baselines.
  - **Layer 3**: **Policy documents** that reference controls and risks; **Layer 2**: Reusable control catalogs and threat mappings.

- **Finn (Finder)**
  - Focus on vulnerabilities and disclosure; less direct authorship of Gemara artifacts but feeds into **threat** and **control** refinement (Layer 2) and evidence for **evaluation/audit** (Layers 5–7).

### 2. Open Source Professional (OSPO, Supplier, Consumer) → Layers 2, 3

- **Siddharth (Supplier)**
  - Needs to understand upstream OSS and comply with regulations; uses Scorecard, SLSA, S2C2F, OSV, OpenVEX.
  - **Layer 2**: Consumes **threat/control catalogs** (e.g. OSPS, CCC) to assess and communicate posture; **Layer 3**: Organizational **policies** that reference those controls.

- **Carl (Consumer)** — vendor/manufacturer ([Toolbelt](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/tree/main/personas))
  - Must **understand the security posture** of the open source software his project consumes; wants the software he's building to **comply with regulatory requirements** and **manage risks associated with consumption**.
  - **Layer 2**: Consumes **control catalogs** and threat catalogs (e.g. OSPS, CCC) to assess posture; **Layer 5**: Evaluation results (e.g. Pass/Fail per control) as in `pvtr-baseline-scan.yaml`.

- **Regulated Ragnar**
  - Strong **Layer 3** (policy, risk) and **Layer 2** (controls that satisfy regulators).

### 3. Infrastructure/Platform Engineer → Layers 2, 5, 6

- **Chinmay (Cloud Platform Admin)**
  - Secures infra, integrates supply chain checks into build/deploy, needs "secure enough" OSS.
  - **Layer 2**: Implements **controls** (e.g. from CCC, OSPS); **Layer 5**: Config/behavior **evaluations**; **Layer 6**: **Enforcement** (gates, remediation).

- **Ophelia (IT Infrastructure Engineer)**
  - CI/CD, Terraform, Argo; wants reusable, secure patterns.
  - Same layer pattern: **controls** in catalogs, **evaluation** in pipelines, **enforcement** on non-compliance.

### 4. Data Operations Practitioner → Layers 1, 2, 3

- **Daniel (Data Scientist)**
  - Reproducibility, model provenance, alignment with regulations.
  - **Layer 1**: **Guidance** (e.g. secure ML, model cards); **Layer 2**: Controls for data/model integrity; **Layer 3**: Data protection **policy**.

- **Dibby (Data Engineer)**
  - Pipeline security, provenance, compliance.
  - **Layer 2**: **Controls** for pipelines (e.g. signing, validation); **Layer 3**: **Policy** for data traceability and compliance.

- **Grear (Data Governance Analyst)**
  - Privacy, classification, auditability.
  - **Layer 3**: **Policy** (GDPR, HIPAA); **Layer 2**: Controls and schemas for classification/lineage; **Layer 7**: **Audit** evidence.

### 5. Software Developer → Layers 1, 4, 5

- **Debbie, Ursula, Danika**
  - Consume **guidance** (Layer 1) and work inside **sensitive activities** (Layer 4); their work is **evaluated** (Layer 5) via control checks (e.g. OSPS in Privateer).

- **Sachiko (Solution Architect), Allison (AI/ML Engineer), Timmy (Test Engineer)**
  - Align architecture and pipelines with **guidance** and **controls** (Layers 1–2); tests and pipelines contribute to **evaluation** (Layer 5).

### 6. Executive / C-Suite → Layers 3, 7

- Own **risk appetite**, **policy** (Layer 3), and consume **audit** and **continuous monitoring** (Layer 7). They approve scope and compliance posture rather than authoring catalogs.

### 7. Product Marketing & Community → Layer 1 (messaging)

- Communicate adoption of **guidance** and baselines (e.g. "aligned with OSPS/OWASP") without necessarily authoring Gemara artifacts.

## Tutorial user journeys (writing vs. ingesting)

For each definition layer, **who writes** the Gemara artifact, **who ingests** it, and **why** are made explicit below.

### Layer 1: Vectors and Guidance

**Personas writing Layer 1 artifacts:** Regulators, governing bodies, or authors of organization-specific guidance for internal reuse (e.g. translating existing controls from a spreadsheet into Gemara Layer 1 for widespread usage and compatibility—see use-cases such as CNCF CNSCC).

| Persona | Why / how |
|---------|-----------|
| **Guinevere** (GRC Security Governance Lead) — regulator/governing-body | Bridges policy and engineering. She has a unique internal use-case: developing guidance for use across **globally distributed teams**. She can author or adopt guidance catalogs that feed into policy and Layer 2. |
| **Grear** (GRC Data Governance Analyst) — regulator/governing-body | Works in a **government agency**; focuses on data/ML against **privacy regulations** (GDPR, HIPAA), traceability, and approvals. Use when guidance is **regulatory or governing-body driven** (e.g. data protection, public sector). |
| **Sachiko** (Solution Architect) — authoring or adopting guidance catalogs | "The person people go to when something needs to scale securely." She shares **reusable secure-by-design blueprints**, aligns architecture with **SLSA and SAMM**, and can create guidance for **secure ML architecture** that Layer 2 can reference (e.g. guideline-mappings) and that maps to external frameworks. |

**Personas ingesting Layer 1 artifacts:** **Guinevere** (as GRC lead) when she pulls Layer 1 into Layer 2—control catalogs reference guidance via **guideline-mappings**. She uses Layer 1 to ensure policies and controls align to standards.

**Outputs:** Guidance catalogs (guidelines, families, mapping-references to OWASP, NIST, etc.). Tutorial: *(Layer 1 coming later)*.

### Layer 2: Threats and Controls

**Personas writing Layer 2 artifacts:** **Pang** (Product Security Engineer).

| Persona | Why / how |
|---------|-----------|
| **Pang** | Expert security engineer who collaborates with product engineers to perform a **secure architecture review** and **threat assessment**: identify **capabilities** and their **associated threats**. He cares how a system can be broken and what **technical controls** can prevent that. He outlines controls that mitigate the threats from the threat assessment and uses the **[FINOS CCC](https://www.finos.org/common-cloud-controls-project) Core** reusable catalog whenever possible to import capabilities, threats, or controls instead of redefining them. |

**Personas ingesting Layer 2 artifacts:**

| Persona | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Guinevere** | Uses Pang's **threat-informed controls** to support **risk mitigation**. She needs to know that a "Data Breach" has $10M impact and that Pang's controls reduce likelihood. Threats are mitigated by controls, which support mitigation of **associated risks** in Layer 3. |
| **Carl** (the Consumer) — vendor/manufacturer ([Toolbelt personas](https://github.com/ossf/toolbelt/tree/main/personas)) | **Ingests** threat and control catalogs (e.g. OSPS Baseline, CCC) to **understand the security posture** of the open source software his project consumes. He wants the software he's building to **comply with regulatory requirements** and **manage risks associated with consumption**. Layer 2 control catalogs and evaluation outputs (e.g. Layer 5 Pass/Fail) give him a clear view of what to satisfy. |

**Outputs:** **Threat catalog** (specific ways capabilities can be misused or exploited); **Control catalog** (defense mechanisms based on what could go wrong). Tutorials: [Threat Assessment Guide](controls/threat-assessment-guide), [Control Catalog Guide](controls/control-catalog-guide).

### Layer 3: Risk and Policy

**Personas writing Layer 3 artifacts:** **Guinevere** (GRC Security Governance Lead). A **Compliance** persona may assist with **assessment plan** and **scope**.

| Persona | Why / how |
|---------|-----------|
| **Guinevere** | She is the **risk manager** who maps **threats to business impact**. She contextualizes Pang's Layer 2 outputs into a **risk register**: she ingests the threat catalog, assigns **business impact** and **likelihood** to turn technical threats into **informed risks**. By mapping risks to the organization's **risk appetite**, she defines **policy**—which risks are **accepted** vs **mitigated** (triggering enforcement of Pang's controls)—and establishes **assessment requirements** for mitigations. Pang's automation can use this policy to pull in and validate the right security controls in the scoped environment. |

**Personas ingesting Layer 3 artifacts:**

| Persona | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Governance lead** (with expertise in scope / assessment plan) | Uses **Layer 1** vectors and guidance, is aware of **technology scope** and **evaluation methods**, and ensures **adherence** (how often assessments and evaluations run). |
| **Grear** (Data Governance Analyst) | Her organization must meet **GDPR and HIPAA**. She uses the policy's **adherence** and **assessment plan** to define how often assessments and evaluations occur and to enable compliance. |

**Outputs:** Policy document (scope, imports, risks, adherence, implementation-plan). Tutorial: *(Layer 3 coming later)*.
